# Retail-Optimization
A comprehensive demand forecasting system built with Facebook Prophet to solve the $1.1 trillion inventory distortion problem in retail. This project demonstrates how machine learning can optimize inventory levels, reduce carrying costs, and prevent stockouts while maintaining high service levels.

Key Results
- 34.7% improvement in forecast accuracy over naive benchmarks (MAE reduction: 120.19 â†’ 78.43 units)

- Near-zero forecast bias (-1.94 units, â‰ˆ1.4% of average daily sales)

- Identified 20-30% potential reduction in safety stock requirements

- Maintained 0% stockout rate while optimizing inventory investment (possible due to using sythetic data)
